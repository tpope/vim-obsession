# obsession.vim

Vim features a `:mksession` command to write a file containing the current
state of Vim: window positions, open folds, stuff like that.  For most of my
existence, I found the interface way too awkward and manual to be useful, but
I've recently discovered that the only thing standing between me and simple,
no-hassle Vim sessions is a few tweaks:

* Instead of making me remember to capture the session immediately before
  exiting Vim, allow me to do it at any time, and automatically re-invoke
  `:mksession` immediately before exit.
* Also invoke `:mksession` whenever the layout changes (in particular, on
  `BufEnter`), so that even if Vim exits abnormally, I'm good to go.
* If I load an existing session, automatically keep it updated as above.
* If I try to create a new session on top of an existing session, don't refuse
  to overwrite it.  Just do what I mean.
* If I pass in a directory rather than a file name, just create a
  `Session.vim` inside of it.
* Don't capture options and maps.  Options are sometimes mutilated and maps
  just interfere with updating plugins.

Use `:Obsess` (with optional file/directory name) to start recording to a
session file and `:Obsess!` to stop and throw it away.  That's it.  Load a
session in the usual manner: `vim -S`, or `:source` it.

## Installation

If you don't have a preferred installation method, I recommend
installing [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen), and
then simply copy and paste:

    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone git://github.com/tpope/vim-obsession.git
