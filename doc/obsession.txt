USAGE                                           *obsession* *:Obsession*

:Obsession {file}       Invoke |:mksession| on {file} and continue to keep it
                        updated until Vim exits, triggering on the |BufEnter|
                        and |VimLeavePre| autocommands.  If the file exists,
                        it will be overwritten if and only if it looks like a
                        session file.

:Obsession {dir}        Invoke |:Obsession| on {dir}/Session.vim.  Use "." to
                        write to a session file in the current directory.

:Obsession              If session tracking is already in progress, pause it.
                        Otherwise, resume tracking or create a new session in
                        the current directory.

:Obsession!             Stop obsession and delete the underlying session file.

Loading a session created with |:Obsession| automatically resumes updates to
that file.

STATUSLINE                                      *obsession-statusline*

                                                *obsession#statusline()*
Add %{obsession#statusline()} to your statusline to get an indication of
Obsession's current tracking status.  If currently obsessing, the indicator
will be '[Obsession]'.  If there is no obsession but a vim session exists, the
indicator will be '[Session]'.

If you don't have a statusline, this one matches the default when 'ruler' is
set:
>
    set statusline=%<%f\ %h%m%r%{obsession#statusline()}%=%-14.(%l,%c%V%)\ %P
<
